/**
 * Description:
 * 	,"This control word specifies that cached paragraph
 * 	information shall be used for column balancing.
 * 	Specifically, this control word specifies that when a
 * 	paragraph's lines have differing heights, an application
 * 	shall treat this paragraph as though it had only one line
 * 	equaling the full paragraph height, regardless of the actual
 * 	number of lines in the paragraph.
 * 	Note   It is
 * 	recommended that applications not intentionally replicate
 * 	this behavior as it was deprecated due to issues with its
 * 	output and is maintained only for compatibility with
 * 	existing documents from a legacy application.
 * 	Typically,
 * 	lines are correctly measured for their height when balancing
 * 	columns as part of an RTF document. This control word
 * 	specifies that applications shall perform the incorrect
 * 	calculation in the conditions described above.
 * 	Note  
 * 	This control word is used to maintain compatibility with
 * 	documents created by Microsoft Office Word 2003.
 * Group:
 * 	Document Formatting Properties
 * Type:
 * 	Flag
 * Default Param:
 * 	0
 * Pass Default:
 * 	false
