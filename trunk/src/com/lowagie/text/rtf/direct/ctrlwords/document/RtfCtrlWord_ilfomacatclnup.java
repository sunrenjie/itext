 * Description:
 * 	," This control word specifies to a consumer the progress in
 * 	the last attempt made by the application to remove unused
 * 	abstract numbering definitions from a given document. If a
 * 	legacy document is opened by a consumer, it may choose to
 * 	remove abstract numbering definitions that are 'orphaned'
 * 	(have no associated numbering definition instances). This
 * 	control word is used by those consumers to indicate their
 * 	progress (if not complete) in reviewing existing abstract
 * 	numbering definitions.
 * 	Note   Removing unused abstract
 * 	numbering definition from a document will reduce the file
 * 	size, but is not required.
 * 	If omitted, then all abstract
 * 	numbering definitions shall be considered reviewed.
