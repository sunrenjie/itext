This file contains some info on the files with extension
*.cmap or *.properties that are shipped in separate jars
(iTextAsian.jar and iTextAsianCmaps.jar).

These files are based on data found on the following page:
http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/acrobat/index_advanced.html
(scroll down to CMaps for PDF 1.4 CJK Fonts).

iTextAsian.jar and/or iTextAsianCmaps.jar contain information about
a selection of Asian fonts that is identical to the information that
is distributed on Adobe's site; but the information was pre-processed
to map directly the Unicode value with CID value using a 64k char array.
The jar also contains font metrics extracted from CJK Adobe fonts.

All these files were produced by core iText developer Paulo Soares
from the original Adobe sources in conformance with Adobe's policy
about third party software that produces/renders/manipulates PDF
documents (as confirmed by Leonard Rosenthol, Adobe's PDF Technical
Standards Evangelist).
