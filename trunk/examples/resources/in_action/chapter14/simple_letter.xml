Hello <givenname />,<newline />
<newline />
I visited your web site a while ago (<website />), and I saw you added a link to iText, my free JAVA-PDF library. So I thought to myself, hey, I'm going to send Mr./Ms. <name /> a little mail to show my gratitude. If you want to, I can also add a link to your site on the iText links-page. Just let me know,<newline />
<newline />
kind regards,<newline />
