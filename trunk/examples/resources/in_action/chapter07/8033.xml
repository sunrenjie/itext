<description>
Imagine a different way to program in which you specify rules and facts
instead of the usual linear set of instructions. That's the idea behind
rule-based programming. A rule engine automatically decides how to apply
the rules to your facts and hands you the result. This approach is ideal
for expressing business rules and is increasingly used in enterprise computing.<newline />
Jess is a popular rule engine written in Java. It's supported by Sandia Labs
and has an active online community. This course is an accessible and practical guide
to rule-based system development in Java.<newline />
The course first introduces rule programming concepts and teaches you
the Jess language. Armed with this knowledge, you then progress through
a series of fully-developed applications chosen to expose you to
practical rule-based development. The course teaches you how you
can add power and intelligence to your Java software.
