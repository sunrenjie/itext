<tagline>Creating full-featured web apps by connecting framework components to economical amounts of application code.</tagline>
<description>Many web development frustrations can be traced back to the underlying stateless
HTTP protocol. Tapestry represents state and behavior as standard Java objects,
methods and properties. That means state management and multithreading are handled
by the framework, leaving you with just your application's business logic.
Tapestry does more, you do less.<newline />
Many simple examples show you how to tackle common tasks such as form
validation, application localization, client-side scripting, and synchronization
between browser and app server. More advanced topics including creation of new
components and integration with J2EE are also discussed.
