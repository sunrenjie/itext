<tagline>Building web applications with the leading Java framework</tagline>
<description>Struts solves the most common problems of web development.
By basing your application on the Struts framework, you can reuse
proven solutions and focus on what's unique to your own case.
Struts is an open-source product distributed by the Apache Software Foundation.
This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the Struts framework.
It covers initial design, data validation, database access, dynamic page assembly,
localization, product configuration, and other important areas. It shows you
how to use both JSP tags and Velocity templates. It carefully explains
the Struts architecture and control flow, as well as how to extend
framework classes.</description>
