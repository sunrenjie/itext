			ADOBE owns the copyright for the PDF specifications, that is true.
            However, using iText to produce documents in PDF is completely legal.<br><br>
			Please read the PDF Reference 1.4 section 1.4. I quote:<br>
			<blockquote>
			Adobe desires to promote the use of the Portable Document Format
            for information interchange among diverse products and applications.
            Accordingly, Adobe gives anyone copyright permission, subject to
            the conditions stated below, to:
			<UL>
			<LI>Prepare files whose content conforms to the Portable Document Format
			<LI>Write drivers and applications that produce output represented in the
			    Portable Document Format
			<LI>Write software that accepts input in the form of the Portable Document
			    Format and displays, prints, or otherwise interprets the contents
			<LI>Copy Adobe’s copyrighted list of data structures and operators, as well
			    as the example code and PostScript language function definitions in
			    the written specification, to the extent necessary to use the Portable
			    Document Format for the purposes above
			</UL>
			The conditions of such copyright permission are:
			<UL>
  	 		<LI>Software that accepts input in the form of the Portable Document Format
    			must respect the access permissions specified in that document.
    			Accessing the document in ways not permitted by the document’s access
			    permissions is a violation of the document author’s copyright.
  			<LI>Anyone who uses the copyrighted list of data structures and operators,
			    as stated above, must include an appropriate copyright notice.
			</UL>
			</blockquote>
			Because decrypting an encrypted PDF-file is not possible with iText
			(and it will never be) and because there are lots of pointers to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</a>
			and to the PDF Reference Manual everytime some explanation is given about
			the data structure, iText is allowed to prepare files whose content conforms
			to the Portable Document Format.

            iText is free in the sense that you don't have to pay money to
            download the product (no purchase price), nor to use it (no license fee).
            However, this doesn't mean you can do anything you want with iText.
            If you use iText, you agree with either the Mozilla Public License (with
            LGPL as alternative license) or the Library General Public License (without MPL).
            You can read more about these licenses in the <a href="#lgpl">next question</A>.
            These licenses are used mainly to protect the developers against claims from users
            and to protect the product against abuse. It wouldn't be fair if someone would
            try to get profit from iText on the back of us, 'benevolent developers' ;-)<br>
            If you work for a large company and using iText has saved your company
            lots of time and money, you can support the developers in several ways:<br>
            <UL>
            <LI>First of all: let us know. Those little mails we get, is it from
                a student who has used iText in a school project, or from a large
                company who has used iText in a complex application, those mails
                are always welcome. We really appreciate them.
            <LI>You can contribute code to ameliorate the library. This doesn't mean
                you have to send us your whole application (see the <A HREF="#lgpl">license question</A>),
                but any code that adds value to the library is welcomed.
            <LI>You can share your expertise with other iText users by answering
                questions on the mailing list. You can save other people lots of time.
            <LI>You can promote the use of iText by posting it to search engines,
                putting a link on your site, recommending it to other people on
                mailing lists and user forums, write articles about it in magazines,...
            <LI>If iText really, really saved your company time and money, you can
                ask your company to <A HREF="#donate">donate money</A> to the original developer
                (Bruno Lowagie) and the co-developer (Paulo Soares).

			<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><A NAME="lgpl"><B>What is MPL / LGPL?</B></A></FONT><BR>
			<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="-1">
			First of all: LGPL IS NOT GPL!<br>
			If you work for a commercial company and you download a program that is published with a GPL,
            I would recommend you to stay away from it, unless you want to use the product AS-IS.
            GPL is like a virus. It affects all the software you add yourself to the product.
			That is my point of view. Not everyone has to agree.<br><br>
			iText was originally published by me (Bruno Lowagie) as LGPL!
            I made iText LGPL because I want to <em>encourage</em> people to use iText
            in their commercial/closed source/propriety software.
			I myself use iText in closed source projects.<br>
            It is allowed to use iText in your own product as long as you don't change the copyright notices.
			You also have to distribute the source code of iText to your clients (or even better, add
			a link to the iText site).<br>
			You can't charge your client for iText, nor for the work you have done 'ameliorating iText'.
			All enhancements or bugfixes have to be published for free.<br>
			Of course you may charge people for your own application and for the work you did integrating
			iText in your product. Your own code may of course remain closed source. For instance:
            if you write an editor that produces PDF, you can charge your customers for the work you
			have done on the editor, but not for the PDF generating part. If you have fixed some bugs
			in iText while writing the code of your product, you have to send a bugreport telling the
			community how to fix these bugs to the mailing list. Lots of people have contributed to the
			code; you will find lots of names in the source code.<br>
			Once you decide to use iText, you accept the code AS-IS. You can't force any of the developers
			to give support (allthough you will get lots of free support through the mailing list). You
			can't sue any of the developers if anything goes wrong. After all, iText is a FREE product.<br><br>
            You can read the LGPL for more detail (see <a href="lgpl.txt">lgpl.txt</a>), but I think the above
            is a good summary.<br><br>
			Because of some quirky details in the LGPL, people developing commercial products
			using iText asked me to move to a less strict license. That's why I made iText multiple licensed.
			iText can be used under MPL too. Read the MPL for more info: <a href="MPL-1.1.txt">MPL-1.1.txt</A>.

            If you send mails to the developers (Bruno Lowagie and/or Paulo Soares),
            one of us can be on vacation, thus unable to give you a quick reply. Also your mail can get
            lost (I delete lots of mails without even reading them; surprised? Well, you probably don't
            receive as many mail as I do). If you post a question to the mailing list, your mail is
            archived and if you don't get answered, you can always refer to it later on.<BR>
            Almost all questions on the mailing list are answered, but there are limits.
            If we get the feeling that you are expecting us to do your school project in your
            place, or even worse, if you want to do us your work in your place for free,
            you will get 'NO' for an answer. This is only normal. We've got our own jobs too.<br>
            If you really need to say something to one of the developers personally and you don't
            want it to be published on the net, please send a mail to <A HREF="mailto:itext@lowagie.com">itext@lowagie.com</A>.

			<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="-1">
            It's very unusual to pay for something that is free, but it happens.
            I have to pay my webserver hosting bills, I buy books about Java and PDF,
            Paulo and I spend time at home to write code, write tutorials, solve problems,...
            We do this on a voluntary basis, but sometimes it's nice to receive a little
            bonus to cover the costs. (Or in my case: also to make up for the time I spend
            on iText to my wife and children ;-)<br>
            That's why you (or more likely: your company) may want to donate some
            money to us. If so, send a mail to <A HREF="mailto:donate@lowagie.com">donate@lowagie.com</A>
            and you will receive, my personal address, the name, address and SWIFT code of my bank and
            my account number. Please specify the amount of money you are willing to donate.<br>
            Again: this is not an obligation. This suggestion is not aimed at you as an individual,
            only at the company you work for, a company that may be making big profits because
            you chose to work with iText instead of another product. (Personally I would ask
            for a raise first ;-)

			<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="-1">
			When you construct or shape the objects Cell (and/or Table), you create content and metadata that will
			allow a writer to make a representation of a Cell (and/or Table). At the moment you are doing this, the
			Cells nor the Table are aware of the presentation format. You could add the object to a Document that is
			listened to by an HtmlWriter, a PdfWriter, an XmlWriter, an RtfWriter, or a combination of any of these writers.
			You can have several PdfWriters listening to one Document. For instance one writer that writes to a file
			that represents a document with A4 portrait as Page Size and another with A4 landscape. Both documents will
			show the same content and metadata, but the cells (and/or table) will have different dimensions. That is
			why it doesn't make sense to ask a Cell (and/or Table) object for its dimensions.

			<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="-1">
			If the source code doesn't compile, this can be caused by three different reasons:
			<ol>
			<li>If the missing classes are for instance java.util.Iterator or java.util.ArrayList,
			this is a sign that your are not using the JDK1.2. You should upgrade your JDK or
			use the <A HREF="#jdk11">1.1.x</A>-version of the library.
			<li>If the missing classes are related to XML, you probably forgot to add the
			iTextXML.jar to your classpath.
			<li>If you are missing non-iText classes (for instance org.xml.sax.Parser),
			you need to put the j2ee.jar in your classpath (in this case the SDK isn't sufficient,
			you need the Java 2 Enterprise Edition). These classes are not used in the iText.jar library,
			only in the additional iTextXML.jar.<br>
			<li>If you have trouble compiling or running the examples on a WINDOWS-OS, you
			can use this batch file: <A HREF="examples/compile.bat">compile.bat</A>. Just run
			it with the name of the example (not the filename) as parameter: for instance:
			'compile Chap0101'.
			<LI>If you are using iText in a Servlet, make sure you have the iText.jar in the right place.
			If you are using Tomcat 4, and want all of your contexts to have access to the classes for iText,
			then you can use the $CATALINA_HOME/common/lib folder. If you want only one context, or
			application on your server to have access to them, they should be placed in a folder that only that
			context can see. For example, for context, 'myApp', it would be $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/myApp/WEB-INF/lib folder.
			(answer by Chris Ward).
			<li>Any other problem with classes that are not found, are caused by errors in your
			classpath. You and you alone can solve these kind of errors, so please don't mail us
			before you're absolutely sure you've checked every detail on your system.

			First read <A href="tutorial/ch06.html">Chapter 6</a> of the tutorial.
			iText supports images (WMF, plain GIFs, JPEGs and PNGs), but there are some limitations!
			<UL>These are the exceptions:
			<LI>GIF
				<UL>
					<LI>Gifs without a global colortable
					<LI>interlaced gifs or gifs using local color table
					<LI>... (check out the error message!)
				</UL>
			<LI>JPG
				<UL>
					<LI>JPG with of which the number of 'Bits Per Component' != 8
					<LI>JPG with 'invalid JPEG markers' (see the code of class Jpeg)
				</UL>
			<LI>PNG
				<UL>
					<LI>PNGs with BitDepth == 16
					<LI>PNGs with another colortype than 0, 2 or 3
					<LI>interlaced PNGs
				</UL>
			</UL>
			GIF is the most delicate format. I followed the GIF specs as good as possible,
			but you must know that there are also some legal limitations (the format is
			owned by Unisys and there is a patent on LZW-compression/decompression). When an image
			is rejected by iText, the exception that gets thrown always gives an explanation;
			for instance:<BR><FONT FACE="Courier">the image separator '0x2c' is not found
			after reading the color table</FONT><BR>
			This is quite a cryptic error message, but the code can't possibly tell you more:
			in the GIF specs, it is specified that the code 0x2c should be used as imageSeparator
			(this is the byte that should separate the section with the GIF-header, the info and
			the color table from the image descriptor). If iText can't find this byte, the library
			can't do anything with the GIF and rejects it...<BR>
			You can try using another tool to create your GIF-file, one that generates images
			that are conform to the specs. You can consider using PNG- or JPG-images instead.
			Or you can use Advanced iText:<br>
			<b>Advanced iText</b> uses the <FONT FACE="Courier">java.awt.Image</FONT>-object from the JDK,
			so if you use this functionality (as described in the advanced example in
			<a href="tutorial/ch06.html#advanced">Chapter 6</a>), you can add all the types of
			images that are supported by the JDK (all kinds of GIFs, TIFF,...).

			<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><a name="preformattedtext"><B>How can I convert preformatted text to PDF?</B></a></FONT><BR>
			<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="-1">
			First you will need to read the file you want to convert:<BR>
			<FONT FACE="Courier">
			Reader in = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream("your_file_name.txt"), yourEncoding);<br>
			</FONT><BR>
			If it's just a plain ASCII-file, you don't need to specify the encoding, but this
			parameter is added to show this functionality can also be used for (a.o.) Asian texts.
			If you have a Japanese text with encoding Shift JIS, the value of parameter yourEncoding should be "SJIS".
			With this reader, you can put the text into a String with UNICODE characters.<br><br>
			If your text is preformatted and you don't want to loose the 'layout', you need to
			put this String in a Paragraph-object that uses a 'fixed width' font and add this
			paragraph to a document. If you use only romanic characters, you can use the font 'Courier'.
			Or you can change the width of the characters yourself (as demonstrated in
			<A HREF="tutorial/ch09.html#fontwidths">Chapter 9</A> of the tutorial), but
			keep in mind that width change only works with type1 and true-type fonts with
			encodings other then IDENTITY-H or IDENTITY-V.<br><br>
			If you are using an Asian Font, you will have to manipulate the String first.<br>
			In the case of Japanese, you can create this BaseFont:<BR>
			<FONT FACE="Courier">
			BaseFont bf = BaseFont.createFont("HeiseiKakuGo-W5", "UniJIS-UCS2-H", BaseFont.NOT_EMBEDDED);
			</FONT><BR>
			Remark: the embedding flag is ignored when built-in fonts and CJK fonts from the
            Adobe font pack are used. Another option is to use msgothic.ttc or msmincho.ttc; these can be embedded.<br>
			You will have to move all characters in the range \u0020-\u007f to the range \uff00-\uff5f.
			That's the "Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms" Unicode range. (Another option is to use courier with
			the romanic characters, but you'll have to change the default widths of 600 to 1000 to match
			the ideographs.) You can put the resulting String in a Paragraph and add it to a document.

            No offense, but if you are reading this question because you need the answer,

            bad taste. You just DON'T GENERATE binaries using JSP.<br>
            However if you want to see how it is done, you can look up the code in the
            <A HREF="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/itext/www/examples/pdf.jsp">CVS repository</A>

            CHECK <A HREF="http://www.lowagie.com/iText/examples/pdf.jsp">pdf.jsp</A> ON MY SITE.
            If this example doesn't work for you, it is probably because you added newlines, spaces, carriage returns,...
            to the original JSP-code. These newlines, spaces, carriage returns,... are added to the PDF
            and make the file corrupt: the crossreference table doesn't point to the correct bytepositions
            anymore. SUMMARIZED: iText for JSP is possible, but don't expect to get any support for it.
