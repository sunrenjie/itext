<div class="title">License Agreement</div>
iText is published under 2 different licenses: MPL and LGPL.<br /><br />
If you are a new user of iText, MPL is recommended (without the LGPL).
MPL is less strict than LGPL. Please read the
<a href="MPL-1.1.txt" class="normal">MPL license agreement</a>
before downloading and/or using iText.<br />
LGPL is maintained for backwarts compatibility only.
If you choose the LGPL, you need to mention the MPL as an alternative license.
Please read the <a href="lgpl.txt" class="normal">LGPL license agreement</a>
for more info.<br /><br />
This library is free and I want it to stay free: you can use it without paying
a fee; you don't need to register anywhere. Only keep in mind that agreeing
with the license is crucial to protect the software, its developers and its users.
Please read section 15 and 16 of the LGPLicense with special attention:
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
any warranty. If you don't like free software, don't (ab)use it!<br /><br />
Some companies have a policy not to use Free / Open Source Software
without a license or a support contract. The iText developers can't and won't sell you
such a contract, but they are currently negociating with Ghent University,
the employer of Bruno, that is interested in providing a license for commercial use.

Please consult the <a href="history.html">history overview</a> for more info.<br />
Another option to get the source code is to download it from the <a href="cvs.html">CVS repository</a>,
for instance using <a href="ant.html">ant getFromCvs</a>. There, you'll always find the most recent iText version.
<div class="title">Compiling the source</div>
The iText jar is compiled with the JDK1.4.
If you are using an older JVM in your environment, you could experience some compatibility problems.
In this case it is better NOT to use the downloaded jar, but to compile the code yourself with your own JDK.
If you have a version older than the JDK1.2, you will have to download an adapted version of the source
code from the <a href="http://itextpdf.sourceforge.net/">Early Access</a> site, as well as the 'Collection'
classes from SUN. If you are using the JDK 1.2 or 1.3, you will probably need some extra J2EE jar for
the packages com.lowagie.text.xml and com.lowagie.text.html. If you don't need the XML/HTML stuff,
you can delete those packages.<br />
There are of course also some ANT scripts that will make getting and compiling the source a lot easier.
There is a separate page on <a href="ant.html">iText ANT scripts</a>.
