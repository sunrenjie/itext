        <div class="text"><UL>
		<LI>added a Font Factory that allows you to register fonts and use them afterwards
		    by specifying their postscript fontname instead of the path to their ttf- or ttc-file
		<LI>added colspan to PdfPTable
		<LI>the interface PdfPTableEvent changed because of colspan.
		    True, interfaces shouldn't change but this interface is used

		    Other encodings using this symbology are possible
		<LI>added PdfWriter.setCropBoxSize()
		<LI>fixed the problem while trying to add 2 images, a big and a small,
            near the bottom of a page. The first image was too large to fit, so it should
            have gone to the next page. However, the resulting pdf contained the second
            (smaller) image at the bottom of the page, while the larger image did
            not appear in the file.
		<LI>simplified PdfReader.getPageSizeWithRotation()
		<LI>fixed a bug in Rectangle that prevented page rotations bigger than 90
            degrees.
		<LI>fixed a bug that prevented annotations to be in the right place with
            rotated pages.
    	<LI>eliminated Rectangle.setRotation(). This can create inconsistencies.
		<LI>fixed a bug that prevented deep nesting in Tables
		<LI>fixed a bug in RtfWriter (escaping of the backslash)
		<LI>moved all the code from com.lowagie.text.markup.* to com.lowagie.text.*

			allows you to generate HTMLs with a CSS file.
		<LI>changed all the constructors that created elements taking a Properties-object
		    as parameter (For future use in the XML functionality).
		<LI>fixed broken functionality: background color of a page
		</UL></div>

        <div class="title"><A NAME="VERSION085">iText0.85</A></div>

		<LI>added support to retrieve the full name of the font in BaseFont.

            page visually on the screen or in print.

		<LI>support for unicode meta tags in pdf such as author.
		<LI>true type fonts can be used in unicode addressing mode. This is the only way
            to use this fonts with some encodings, such as Thai. CJK fonts can also be
            used this way, in fact, all the encodings can be used this way at the expense
            of 2 bytes per character instead of one.
		<LI>support for true type font subsets. Only the glyphs actually used in the
            document are stored. The reduction of document size with fonts embedded
            is dramatic.
		<LI>support for having different line break characters.
		<LI>changed greek character handling in Phrase. Only the fonts (class Font) not
            constructed with BaseFont are elected to be automatically replaced with
            Symbol when greek characters are present. It was impossible to use a font
            with greek characters without them being replaced automatically.

   			colapsed.
		<LI>improved line breaking for CJK fonts.
		<LI>support for windows metafiles.

   			Fix provided by Jin-Hsia Yang.
		<LI>corrected the parameters bounds in PdfContentByte.setLineCap and
