<P>What formats does a webdeveloper think of when asked a question on the subject of documents? Undoubted his first thoughts will go to <STRONG>HTML (<EM>HyperText Markup Language</EM>)</STRONG>. Without HTML, there would probably never have been a world wide web.<BR />In the second place, he will think of <STRONG>XML (<EM>eXtensible Markup Language</EM>)</STRONG>. XML is the ideal format for Presentation-Oriented Publishing and/or Message-Oriented Middleware.</P>
<P>However, there is a third format that is at least as important when talking about documents for the web, especially when looking from the point of view of the end user. In spite of all efforts to promote the concept of the '<EM>Paperless Office</EM>', there will always be situations where the end user will want to print a document. And what is he going to print? XML? No way! HTML? We all know this can lead to some very ugly and even unreadable results, depending on the browser used to render the HTML code. WORD? Maybe, but not every end user works on a MicroSoft Operating System, and those who do, may have different versions of WORD installed. Seriously: in an ideal world, the end user will want to print a PDF document.</P>
<P>PDF is the native format of the <STRONG>Adobe (R) Acrobat (R)</STRONG> products from <ADOBE />. The goal of these products is to enable users to exchange and view electronic documents easily and reliably, independent of the environment in which they were created. PDF relies on the imaging model of the <EM>PostScript (R)</EM> language to describe text and graphics in a device-independent and resolution-independent manner. A PDF file is not a PostScript language program and cannot be directly interpreted by a PostScript interpreter. However, the page descriptions in a PDF file can be converted into a PostScript language program. The main reason that the PDF marking operators differ from the PostScript language marking operators is that PDF is not a programming language and does not contain procedures, variables, or control constructs. To improve performance for interactive viewing, PDF defines a more structured format than that used by most PostScript language programs. PDF trades reduced flexibility for improved efficiency: PDF page descriptions can be drawn more quickly. Because arbitrary programming constructs are not permitted, applications can more efficiently locate and visualize strings in a PDF. In other words: PDF is the ideal format to use on a '<EM>thin client</EM>'. In general, a PDF file is a ReadOnly document, containing 1 or more pages of text, graphics and images. It can also contain information for interactive use (possible only in an electronic representation), such as annotations, hypertext links,....).</P>
<P>Summary:<UL><LI>PDF is a format that is platform-, software- and hardware-independent.</LI><LI>PDF is ideal for use on a thin client.</LI><LI>PDF is very useful for interactive documents.</LI></UL>
