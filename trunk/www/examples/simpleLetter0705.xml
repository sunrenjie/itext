Hello <givenname />,<newline />
<newline />
I visited your website a while ago (<website />) and I saw you added
a link to iText, my free JAVA-PDF library. So I thought to myself, hey,
I'm going to send mr <name /> a little mail to thank him.
If you want to I can also add a link to your site on the iText links-page.
Just let me know,<newline />
<newline />
kind regards,<newline />
