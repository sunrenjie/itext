<div>
If you want to create a Rectangle (PageSize), define a margin, choose a font size
or add something at an absolute place, you might wonder what measurement unit
is used: centimeters, inches, points or pixels. In fact, the default measurement
system roughly corresponds to the various definitions of the typographic unit of measurement
known as the point. There are 72 points in 1 inch.<br />
If you want to create a rectangle in PDF that has the size of an A4-page, you have
to calculate the number of points:<ul>
<li>21 cm / 2.54 = 8.2677 inch</li>
<li>8.2677 * 72 = 595 points</li>
<li>29.7 cm / 2.54 = 11.6929 inch</li>
<li>11.6929 * 72 = 842 points</li>
</ul>

		<site:sectiontitle>The coordinate system</site:sectiontitle>
<div>
When you want to add some text, a template, an image,... at an absolute position,
you need to specify an X and Y coordinate. It is very important to know that the
null position (x = 0; y = 0) in the PDF coordinate system is located in the
lower left corner of your page (not the upper left corner as is sometimes assumed).
This is not an iText specific choice. This is documented in the PDF Reference Manual.
<site:source class="XandYcoordinates" />
Remark: if you measure the locations on the page, you will see that the distances
measured from the bottom or the left side of the page are not always correct.
Adobe's print dialog has several options (like "fit to paper") that change
the printed result.

		<site:sectiontitle>How to create a new page in iText</site:sectiontitle>
<div>
It strikes me how many times this question is asked on the mailing-list.
The method you need to create a new page isn't that cryptic:
<site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Document" target="newPage()">document.newPage()</site:doc>.
Of course, there is a little caveat. If you invoke <span class="commandline">newPage</span>
and the current page is blank, no new page will be added. You can only insert blank pages by
adding something 'invisible' to the page. In the example below, a
<site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Chunk" target="NEWLINE">Chunk.NEWLINE</site:doc> is added.
<site:source class="NewPage" />
