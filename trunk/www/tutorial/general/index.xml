<div>
When I learned my first programming language (some old BASIC dialect
on a <a href="http://www.99er.net/">TI-99/4A Home Compiter</a>),
one of the first programs I made was a 'Hello World' example.
The year was 1982, my age: 12. Now, more than 20 years later,
I am still writing the same program: a standalone example that
prints 'Hello World', this time not on the cyan colored Texas Instruments screen,
but in a PDF document file.<br />
This example shows you the 5 basic steps you have to take for every
new PDF document you are creating from scratch with iText:
<ul>
<li><b>Step 1:</b> Create an <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Document" target="constructor_summary">instance</site:doc> of <site:src class="com.lowagie.text.Document" />:
<div class="commandline"></div>Document document = new Document();</li>
<li><b>Step 2:</b> Create a Writer (for instance <site:src class="com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfWriter" />) that listens to this document and writes the document to the OutputStream of your choice:
<div class="commandline">PdfWriter.getInstance(document, new FileOutputStream("Chap0101.pdf"));</div></li>
<li><b>Step 3: Open the document:</b>
<div class="commandline">document.open();</div></li>
<li><b>Step 4:</b> Add content to the document:
<div class="commandline">document.add(new Paragraph("Hello World"));</div></li>
<li><b>Step 5:</b> Closes the document:
<div class="commandline">document.close();</div></li>
</ul>
<site:source class="HelloWorld" />
In the following sections, we will take a closer look into each step.

		<site:sectiontitle>step 4: adding content</site:sectiontitle>
		<div>
There are different ways to add content to a PDF file.
The easiest way is to use <site:tutorial chapter="" section="part2">high level objects</site:tutorial>
such as Chunk, Phrase, Paragraph,...
It is very important to realize that not all types of these objects are supported
in all types of writers. For instance:  the <site:docs class="com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfPTable">PdfPTable</site:docs>-object
is only supported in PDF, not in RTF or HTML. If you add a <site:docs class="com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfPTable">PdfPTable</site:docs>
to a Document, the listening <site:docs class="com.lowagie.text.rtf.RtfWriter2">RtfWriter</site:docs>s or <site:docs class="com.lowagie.text.html.HtmlWriter">HtmlWriter</site:docs>s
will ignore this.<br />
If you don't need RTF or HTML, you can also add content at
<site:tutorial chapter="" section="part3">absolute positions</site:tutorial>.
A lot of the standard PDF syntax is supported in iText, so you can do some
very powerful things with the library.<br />
Adding content using the <site:docs class="com.lowagie.text.pdf.PdfGraphics2D">PdfGraphics2D</site:docs>-object
(extends <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics2D.html">java.awt.Graphics2D</a>) is
also possible. You can read more about this elsewhere in the tutorial.

	<site:section>
		<site:sectiontitle>step 5: closing the document</site:sectiontitle>
		<div>
 Closing the document is very important, because it flushes and closes the outputstream to which the writer is writing. The close-method is called in the finalize-method, but you shouldn't count on that. You should always close the document yourself!
