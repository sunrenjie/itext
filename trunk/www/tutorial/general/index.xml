When I learned my first programming language (some old BASIC dialect
on a <a href="http://www.99er.net/">TI-99/4A Home Compiter</a>),
one of the first programs I made was a 'Hello World' example.
The year was 1982, my age: 12. Now, more than 20 years later,
I am still writing the same program: a standalone example that
prints 'Hello World', this time not on the cyan colored Texas Instruments screen,
but in a PDF document file.<br />
This example shows you the 5 basic steps you have to take for every
new PDF document you are creating from scratch with iText:
<ul>
<li><b>Step 1:</b> Creates an <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.Document" target="constructor_summary">instance</site:doc> of <site:src class="com.lowagie.text.Document" />.</li>
</ul>
