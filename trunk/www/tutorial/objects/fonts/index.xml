PDF prescribes a set of 14 standard fonts that can be used without prior definition.
These include four faces each of three Latin text typefaces (Courier,
Helvetica and Times), as well as two symbolic fonts (Symbol and ITC Zapf
Dingbats &#210;). These fonts, or suitable substitute fonts with the same metrics, are
considered to be available in all PDF consumer applications. You don't have to
embed them in your PDF document.
