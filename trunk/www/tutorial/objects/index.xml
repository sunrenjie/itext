A Chunk is the smallest significant part of text that can be added to a document.
It is the 'atom' building block of most of the other High Level Text objects.
All the contents of a Chunk are of the same font, fontsize, style, color, etc...
For the complete functionality on this object, please read the <site:tutorial chapter="/objects/chunk">chapter on the Chunk object</site:tutorial>.
Functionalities such as subscript, superscript, underline and background are demonstrated in the following example:
<site:source class="Chunks" />
