Since version 1.2.4 of iText, it's possible to add EPS images into your document (as a com.lowagie.text.Image).
EPS is an extension of the PostScript graphics file format developed by Adobe Systems.
Support in iText for this format is very basic, but it should be useful for simple logos.

iText also supports TIFF. TIFF is the Tagged Image File Format.
It was developed in 1986 by an industry committee chaired by the
Aldus Corporation (now part of Adobe). Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard
were also on the committee. It is unique in that it incorporates
multiple compression techniques, allowing the user to specify
the best format for a type of image, and that one file can contain
multiple images. TIFFs are common in desktop publishing,
faxing, and medical imaging applications.<br />
The examples below can be used as standalone tools.
Tiff2Pdf converts a TIFF file into a PDF file.
If the TIFF has more than one image, a PDF with more than one page will be generated.

The OddEven example was inspired by a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tifftools/">tiffmesh example</a>,
which is part of another SourceForge library <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tifftools/">TiffTools</a>.
Tiffmesh is a utility to mesh together two TIFF files containing odd and even pages into one big TIFF file.
So if you use a scanner to scan in text from double-sided pages, you can scan the odd pages into one tiff
and the even pages into another one. With Tiffmesh you can knit both files together into one tiff.
With the OddEven-example/tool, you can do the same to combine both files into one PDF document.
