    	  The RtfWriter2 provides components for most of the RTF specification,
    	  but not for everything. This is where the <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.rtf.direct.RtfDirectContent">RtfDirectContent</site:doc>
    	  comes into play. Using this object arbitrary RTF code can be added into the document "as is". The
    	  <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.rtf.direct.RtfDirectContent">RtfDirectContent</site:doc> provides no further
    	  support for adding RTF content and it is up to the creator to specify correct RTF code.<br /><br />
    	  
    	  The <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.rtf.direct.RtfDirectContent">RtfDirectContent</site:doc> provides
    	  one predefined constant and that is the RTF code for a soft line-break.
    	  
    	  <pre class="commandline">
// Add the contents before the linebreak
par.add("This paragraph contains a soft linebreak");

// Add the soft linebreak
par.add(RtfDirectContent.DIRECT_SOFT_LINEBREAK);

// Add the contents after the linebreak
par.add("just before the just.");
    	  </pre>

    	  <site:source class="SoftLineBreak" />

    	<site:sectiontitle>Importing RTF documents</site:sectiontitle>
    	<div>
    	  The RtfWriter2 also provides an interface for importing existing RTF documents via two
    	  methods
    	  <ul>
    	    <li><b>RtfWriter2.importRtfDocument</b>: Imports a complete RTF document. Will attempt
    	      to automagically translate the font and colour numbers in the original RTF document
    	      into the font and colour numbers used in the new RTF document.</li>
    	    <li><b>RtfWriter2.importRtfFragment</b>: Imports an RTF fragment. A <site:doc class="com.lowagie.text.rtf.direct.RtfImportMappings">RtfImportMappings</site:doc>
    	      must be provided that describes the mappings between the font and colour numbers in the imported
    	      RTF fragment to actual colours and font names.</li>
    	  </ul><br />
    	  
    	  While the <span class="commandline">importRtfFragment</span> method is stable, the
    	  <span class="commandline">importRtfDocument</span> should currently be considered alpha quality code.
    	  Simple RTF documents should work, but complex documents can lead to problems.<br /><br />
    	  
    	  More detailed documentation will be forthcoming, when the stability of the code improves.
