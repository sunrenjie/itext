	<site:intro>
		iText is a library that allows developers to extend the capabilities of
		their web server (and other JAVA) applications with dynamic PDF document
		generation. In this tutorial, you will find lots of standalone examples
		to learn how to use most of the iText functionality and features.
		It should be easy to integrate most of the solutions in a Servlet, a
		Java Web Start application or some other Java program.
