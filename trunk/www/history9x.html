        <LI>added a file attachment annotation.
        <LI>the subtype for the ink annotation was wrong.
        <LI>modified toPdf() method to write directly to the stream. OutputStreamCounter was created to aid.

        <LI>added methods in PdfPTable to set absolute column widths.
        <LI>added PdfReader.getMetadata() to get the XML metadata.

        <div class="text"><UL>
		<LI>paulo 112<UL>
		    <LI>fixed a race condition in TrueTypeFont.java. The same file was used by all the threads instead of a new instance. Thanks to William Pennoyer for reporting the bug.
            </UL>
        <LI>paulo 111<UL>
	        <LI>fixed a bug in AcroFields that prevented form flattening to work with fields with no appearances.
            <LI>added FdfWriter to create FDF forms.
            <LI>fixed PdfName to work with any characters.
            <LI>changed Color.WHITE to Color.white to compile in jdk 1.3.
            <LI>added rectangular print to PdfPTable. Useful to manage wide tables.
            <LI>the fdfmerge and field_merge examples were changed to support writing to the console.
            <li>the constant Font.TIMES_NEW_ROMAN was eliminated and replaced by Font.TIMES_ROMAN to match the actual font used. The result is a compile error easily correctable. Compiled libraries depending on iText wont't change the behavior because the number is the same.
            <LI>the alignment constants in PdfContentByte were changed to match the constants in Element. This breaks compiled libraries as the number has changed. A recompile is needed. 
            </UL>
        <LI>paulo 110<UL>
	        <LI>Added support for form filling, form flattening and FDF merging.

            <LI>fixed PdfCopy to interpret correctly some objects when copying.
            <LI>when adding annotations the page content for the current page will be generated. For other pages PdfWriter.setPageEmpty() was added to force a page output.
            <LI>much better support for reading GIFs without AWT, including transparency. Contribution by Tim Bruylants.
            <LI>fixed a bug in PdfWriter that prevented the fields to be added with PdfCopy, only the widget annotations were being added.
            <LI>embedding font restrictions for TrueType are honored.
            <LI>added TextField to create text, list and combo fields with all the options that the Acrobat GUI provides. All the borders, appearances, etc, are correctly generated including the standard and external fonts.

            <LI>removed extra moveTo in PdfAcroForm.
            <LI>fixed a missing break in PdfAction.
            <LI>inverted the rectangle coordinates in several places to avoid negative dimensions.
            <LI>fixed a problem with thick lines in Table.
            <LI>Element.HEADER was changed to cast to Meta in PdfDocument.
            <LI>fixed a wrong indentation in header/footer. Contribution by Edgar Perilla.

            </UL>
        <LI>paulo 107<UL>
	        <LI>PdfGraphics2D now implements strokes as strokes instead as converted fills. File size is a lot smaller and it looks better on screen.

            <LI>fixed bug with single cell nested Table.
            <LI>Unicode support for field names.

            </UL>
        <LI>paulo 105<UL>
	        <LI>added xref rebuild capabilities to PdfReader. Slightly damaged PDFs will now read successfully. The rebuild strategy is the same as xpdf. A new method PdfReader.isRebuilt() was introduced to check if the document had to be fixed.
            </UL>
        <LI>paulo 104<UL>

        <LI>fixed the kerning in TrueTypeFont.java
        <LI>PdfContentByte.showText(PdfTextArray text) was made public
        <LI>added PdfContentByte.createGraphicsShapes(). Instead of using pdf fonts, only the shapes are used. The advantage is that the alignment is more precise and all Graphics2D text is allowed including arabic and hebrew. The disavantage is that the text is not searchable and the fonts look like type3 fonts (remember old tex->dvips->gs?)
        <LI>more consistent setPageSize() in pdf.
