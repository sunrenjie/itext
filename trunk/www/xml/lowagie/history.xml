Let's forget about release 0.88.

		<LI>Some errors in the metrics are corrected using an AFM-parser

		<LI>I made some changes in the class <span class="commandline">PdfFont</span>.
			Some methods are moved to the class <span class="commandline">PdfFontMetrics</span>.

<site:changelog>some significant changes in the Font classes.</site:changelog>
</site:release>

<site:release number="V020" name="rugPDF 0.20" date="December 1st, 1999">
<site:changelog>
<UL>
<LI>I reinitialized all the versions of the Pdf Classes (version numbers)</LI>
<LI>Most references to the reference manual version 1.2 are changed into
references to the reference manual version 1.3.</LI>
<LI>I made a distinction between a <span class="commandline">PdfException</span> and a
<span class="commandline">BadPdfFormatException</span> (for future use)</LI>
<LI>Some extra methods were added to check the type of a <span class="commandline">PdfObject</span>.</LI>
<LI>The method type() was removed from the <span class="commandline">PdfPrintable</span>-interface.
The method toPdfString() was alse removed. A <span class="commandline">PdfString</span> can now
be constructed with a <span class="commandline">PdfPrintable</span> as parameter.</LI>
<LI>Some methods are made final to improve performance (more will follow).</LI>
<LI>I am changing most of the String manipulations into <span class="commandline">StringBuffer</span>
or <span class="commandline">ByteArrayOutputstream</span> manipulations.
This avoids creating many temporary strings and improves the performance.</LI>
<LI>The content of each <span class="commandline">PdfObject</span> is now stored as an array of byte.
The method toPdf() returns <span class="commandline">byte[]</span>. This was necessary because
the constructor <span class="commandline">new String(byte[] bytes)</span> and the method <span class="commandline">toBytes()</span> did funny things with some bytes.<BR />
On UNIX everything worked just fine, but on Windows every PDF document
opened correctly (because the PDF syntax was still OK), however since some
bytes of the stream were corrupted, the streams were never decompressed
and every page remained blank...<BR />
This was caused by datatransfer problems on Windows.</LI>
<LI>I have made a static final list of the most common <span class="commandline">PdfName</span>-objects.
This way these objects are constructed only once. There is no more need
to catch a <span class="commandline">BadPdfFormatException</span>.</LI>
<LI><span class="commandline">PdfName</span> has been made comparable; Items in a
<span class="commandline">PdfDictionary</span> are now sorted alfabetically.</LI>
<LI><span class="commandline">PdfStream</span>-object are now compressed.
This way the size of the generated PDF-documents
has been reduced a lot.</LI>
<LI>4 new functions have been added to <span class="commandline">PdfDocument.java</span>:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>public int left(int margin)</LI>
<LI>public int right(int margin)</LI>
<LI>public int top(int margin)</LI>
<LI>public int bottom(int margin)</LI>
</UL>
<LI>I changed the values of the static variables concerning the size of
a font. You can still use them, but they aren't really necessary anymore.
You have now the freedom to choose any size you want (as long as it's an
integer).</LI>
