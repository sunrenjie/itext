		iText is a library that allows you to generate PDF files on the fly.<br />
		<br />
		The iText classes are very useful for people who need to generate
		read-only, platform independent documents containing text, lists,
		tables and images. The library is especially useful in combination
		with Java<SUP>(TM)</SUP> technology-based Servlets: The look and feel of HTML
		is browser dependent; with iText and PDF you can control exactly
        how your servlet's output will look.<br />
		<br />
		iText requires JDK 1.2. It's available for free under a multiple license: MPL and LGPL.
		<div class="title">New release / new tutorial</div>
		I will be working on a new release and a new tutorial from 11/11 till 11/20.
		I will make a temporary release the first week of november and a more definitive release
		the last week of november.
		<DIV CLASS="title">An ideal introduction for new iText users:</DIV>
		If the <a href="docs.html">tutorial</a> is too difficult or outdated,
		you can start with these <a href="http://www.cdjdn.com/downloads/itextexample.zip">examples</a>.
		Mark Stark has made a powerpoint presentation and a war file, introducing
		the generation of PDFs, filling/reading Acrobat forms and deploying iText in a web application.<br />
		Another interesting presentation is the powerpoint Sean Sullivan made for the Portland Java Users Group in Portland Oregon USA.
		The topic was iText and PDF. You can download his PowerPoint slides <a href="http://itext.sourceforge.net/docs/pdf-itext-pjug-2003-05-27.ppt">here</a>
        or you can read the <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/06/18/dynamic_files.html">article</a>
        he wrote for O'Reilly's <a href="http://www.onjava.com/">onJava.com</a>:
        <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/06/18/dynamic_files.html">Dynamically Creating PDFs in a Web Application</a>.
		<DIV CLASS="title">Technical Requirements</DIV>
		In order to be able to use these classes you should be
		acquainted with JAVA (TM) programming.<br />
		You'll also need the following Software:<br />
		<ul>
		<li>The Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.2 (or any later version)
		from <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems Incorporated</a>.<br />
		If for some reason the library should have to work with an
		earlier version of the JDK, you will have to download the
		1.1.x version maintained by Paulo Soares
		(you'll find the Source on his <A HREF="http://itextpdf.sourceforge.net/" CLASS="normal">site</A>).</li>
		<li>Adobe Acrobat Reader from Adobe Systems Incorporated:<br />
		<br />
