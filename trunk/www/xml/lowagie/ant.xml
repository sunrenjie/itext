<div class="title">A Neat Tool (What is ANT?)</div>
iText comes with a handful of ANT scripts that makes it easy for the developers of iText to compile the code, make a new release,
build their site(s). But those scripts are useful for iText users too.
<blockquote>Apache Ant is a Java-based build tool. In theory, it is kind of like Make, but without Make's wrinkles.</blockquote>
If you want to download or install ant, please go to the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ANT site @ Apache.org</a>. On this page,
you will only find how to use ANT in the context of the iText project.
<div class="title">build.xml</div>
Every self respecting JAVA project has its build.xml file.
If you look at the iText <a href="ant/build.xml">build.xml</a> file,
you will see that the master build.xml calls different subscripts.
You can call most of the targets from this master build.xml,
but for some of the specialized (hidden) targets, you will need to
call the subscript directly with <span class="commandline">build -f</span>.
The default target of the build.xml is 'help' and this is what you get if
you call this target:<br />
<pre class="commandline">
Buildfile: build.xml
