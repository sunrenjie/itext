			<LI>tutorial Chapter on RTF by Mark Hall
			<LI>fonts can also be loaded from byte arrays, not only from files
			<LI>fonts can be loaded without being cached
			<LI>added BaseFont.getPostscriptFontName(), BaseFont.getCodePagesSupported() (this gets the code pages
                supported by the font. This has only meaning with True Type fonts.) and BaseFont.enumerateTTCNames()
				(to list all the names inside a TTC font)

			<LI>added suport for True Type Collections. Quite useful for using CJK
		      	fonts in Windows, such as msgothic.ttc, where the fonts are in this
      			format.

		<UL>
			<LI>Further ameliorations in the Table-class (all Table bugs should be fixed now)
			<LI>corrected bug with jpg images input as a byte array.
			<LI>added open actions. When the document is opened an action can be called
                to position the document in a certain page or to call an URL, for example.
			<LI>support for unicode meta tags in pdf such as author.
			<LI>true type fonts can be used in unicode addressing mode. This is the only way
                to use this fonts with some encodings, such as Thai. CJK fonts can also be
                used this way, in fact, all the encodings can be used this way at the expense
                of 2 bytes per character instead of one.
			<LI>support for true type font subsets. Only the glyphs actually used in the
                document are stored. The reduction of document size with fonts embedded
                is dramatic.
			<LI>support for having different line break characters.
			<LI>changed greek character handling in Phrase. Only the fonts (class Font) not
                constructed with BaseFont are elected to be automatically replaced with
                Symbol when greek characters are present. It was impossible to use a font
                with greek characters without them being replaced automatically.

			<LI>Ameliorations in the Table-class
			<LI>correction in PdfEncryption. The mask permission bits were incorrect and

			<LI>chapters and sections have the option of presenting themselves as opened or
      			colapsed.
			<LI>improved line breaking for CJK fonts.
			<LI>support for windows metafiles.

			<LI>the last row in a nested PdfPTable is stretched to occupy the entire cell.
      			Fix provided by Jin-Hsia Yang.
			<LI>corrected the parameters bounds in PdfContentByte.setLineCap and

		<LI>I am changing most of the String manipulations into <CODE>StringBuffer</CODE>
			or <CODE>ByteArrayOutputstream</CODE> manipulations.
			<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">This avoids creating many temporary strings
			and improves the performance.</FONT>
		<LI>The content of each <CODE>PdfObject</CODE> is now stored as an array of byte.
			The method toPdf() returns <CODE>byte[]</CODE>. This was necessary because
			the constructor <CODE>new String(byte[] bytes)</CODE> and the method <CODE>
			toBytes()</CODE> did funny things with some bytes.<BR>
			On UNIX everything worked just fine, but on Windows every PDF document
			opened correctly (because the PDF syntax was still OK), however since some
			bytes of the stream were corrupted, the streams were never decompressed
			and every page remained blank...<BR>
			This was caused by: DATA TRANSFER PROBLEMS ON WINDOWS
			see: <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1.7B/README">
			http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1.7B/README</A><BR>
			Or run this code on a windows PC to understand the problem:
			<A HREF="http://www.lowagie.com/iText/docs/Encoding.java">Encoding.java</A>.
		<LI>I have made a static final list of the most common <CODE>PdfName</CODE>-objects.
			This way these objects are constructed only once. There is no more need
			to catch a <CODE>BadPdfFormatException</CODE>.
		<LI><CODE>PdfName</CODE> has been made comparable; Items in a
			<CODE>PdfDictionary</CODE> are now sorted alfabetically.
		<LI><CODE>PdfStream</CODE>-object are now compressed.
			<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">This way the size of the generated PDF-documents
			has been reduced a lot.</FONT>
		<LI>4 new functions have been added to <CODE>PdfDocument.java</CODE>:
			<UL>
			<LI>public int left(int margin)
			<LI>public int right(int margin)
			<LI>public int top(int margin)
			<LI>public int bottom(int margin)
			</UL>
		<LI>I changed the values of the static variables concerning the size of
			a font. You can still use them, but they aren't really necessary anymore.
			You have now the freedom to choose any size you want (as long as it's an
			integer).
