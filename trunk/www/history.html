		    <UL>
		        <LI>added bidirectional support in ColumnText and PdfPTable for arabic and hebrew.
		            Even with plain text the line splitting is improved. Hyphenation and CID addressed CJK fonts
		            support were temporarily removed. (Paulo)
                <LI>added support for ICC color profiles in images. Contribution by Phillip Pan.
                <LI>added javascript support for html. Contribution by Joachim Eyrich.
                <LI>fixed a bug in Graphic.drawBorder(). (Paulo)
                <LI>imported pdf documents are closed even if an exception is thrown. (Paulo)
                <LI>fixed a bug in CCITTG4Encoder. Some bit sequences threw an exception. (Paulo)
                <LI>cjkfonts.properties and cjkencodings.properties are now together with the afm. (Paulo)
                <LI>added transition support for pdf. Contribution by Josselin PUJO.
                <LI>fixed the missing bookmarks in jdk 1.2. (Paulo)
                <LI>improved suport for WMF (Paulo)

		    <UL>
		        <LI>fixed a problem with multiple repeated images in Table
		        <LI>fixed the kerning in TrueTypeFont.java
		        <LI>PdfContentByte.showText(PdfTextArray text) was made public
		        <LI>added PdfContentByte.createGraphicsShapes(). Instead of using pdf
                    fonts, only the shapes are used. The advantage is that the alignment
                    is more precise and all Graphics2D text is allowed including arabic
                    and hebrew. The disavantage is that the text is not searchable and
                    the fonts look like type3 fonts (remember old tex->dvips->gs?)
                <LI>more consistent setPageSize() in pdf.
                <LI>added PdfWriter.setSpaceCharRatio(). Sets the ratio between the extra
                    word spacing and the extra character spacing when the text is fully
                    justified. This is also extended to ColumnText and PdfPCell for finer
                    control
                <LI>Some RTF bugfixes by Scott Dietrich
                <LI>Small update by Marcelo Vanzin in the package com.lowagie.servlets
                <LI>Some small changes to the XML package
                <LI>Asian fonts are in a separate jar now. The AFM fonts are in the src as well as in the jar.

		    <UL>Remark: iText0.93b fixes some problems with fonts: some of the fontfiles in 0.93 were corrupt.
		    <UL>Paulo 101:
		        <LI>fixed a bug in PdfReader.getCropBox(). It was returning the media box instead of the crop box
		        <LI>added page and outline reordering. Mainly of interest to generate TOC in a single pass
		        <LI>deprecated PdfContentByte.addOutline(PdfOutline outline). The outlines are extracted from the root outline. It's no longer needed to call this method
		        <LI>changed the behavior for the margins in PDF. Margins now work as the page size: are only active in the next page. Will break some code but it didn't work as it was, anyway
		    </UL>
		    <UL>Paulo 100:
		        <LI>Added PdfEncryptor to encrypt any PDf document. All the content, links, outlines, etc, are also encrypted and output

		        <LI>PdfPCell supports rightIndent and followingIndent for independent alignment within the cell
		        <LI>added class VerticalText for enhanced support for vertical text.
                    Anottation support is not there yet. I would appreciate some feedback
                    from CJK users for ways to improve the vertical layouting

		    </UL>
		    <UL>Paulo 98:
		        <LI>added PdfWriter.setAdditionalAction() to support additional-actions in the catalogue. This is a PDF1.4 only feature.
		        <LI>added PdfReader.getInfo() to get the metadata information from a PDF document.
		        <LI>no-wrap in PdfPCell now works correctly for all the horizontal alignments.
		        <LI>minor fix in HyphenationAuto.getHyphenatedWordPre() to optimize the available word space.
		        <LI>new supplements in CJKFont to support the new characters in PDF1.4. It's still compatible with PDF1.3.
		    </UL>
			<UL>Paulo 97:
				<LI>several changes in the internal pdf structure to allow more low level access.
				<LI>supported full PDFDocEncoding in strings (the Euro will show up).
				<LI>several changes in the form fields to allow strings in Unicode and PDFDocEncoding
				<LI>added shading patterns. Supported type 1, 2, and 3. Types 2 and 3 have duplicated simpler contructors for the case of linear gradients.
				<LI>added support for java.awt.GradientPaint in PdfGraphics2D
				<LI>documents with no text do not generate anymore the empty sequence BT-ET. Some postscript printers had problems with it.
				<LI>added the method Document.getVersion() to get the current iText version string.

			<UL>
				<LI>added PdfGraphics2D, a Graphics2D canvas to write to PDF.
				    Main contribution by Jim Moore with several bits from Jeremy Bowman and Kevin Galligan
				<LI>Added automatic hyphenation to Chunk.
				    It uses the FOP engine and the TEX patterns.
					I provide a jar with some compiled patterns.
					Other patterns can be compiled and included in a jar or read directly from a directory.
					To compile the patterns you'll need xerces but not to use them. 
				<LI>the pdf version can be changed with PdfWriter.setPdfVersion().
				    This only alters the number, it doesn't check if the objects inside are valid for the version.
